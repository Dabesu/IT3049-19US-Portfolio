            <h2>About me</h2>
            
            <p>I'm currently a UC student pursuing Software Development.</p>
            <p>I decided to make this website to demonstrate and show</p>
            <p>one of my many hobbies. I spend a lot of time crafting </p>
            <p>and tinkering things. I play guitar, bass, sing, design &</p>
            <p>enjoy music as my hobbies! As a person I find myself</p>
            <p>invested in my crafts to it's full extent. Almost like a niche</p>
            <p>to trying to make things perfect. I was born in Louisville, KY</p>
            <p>and I spend a lot of my time in Cincinnati, Orlando, and New York City.</p>
            <p>I hope this page serves you well and hope for the best. Cheers!</p>
